# SourceConnectDevTool
## Description: Source Connect Development Tool Automation for Database Management and Automation Plan

## 1. SQL Files for Source and Stage Databases
- **Objective:** Maintain separate SQL files for source and stage databases for clarity and version control.
- **Details:**
  - Organize SQL files into separate folders by database and schema.
  - Ensure proper naming conventions to reflect purpose and schema (e.g., `source_<object_type>_<object_name>.sql`).

## 2. Schema Management
### Main Schema for Release Versions
- **Policy:** The main schema will represent stable release versions.
- **Development Workflow:**
  - Developers will use separate development schemas for their work.
  - Changes should be manually updated into the main schema post-verification.
  
### Idea: Direct Update from Development Schema to Main Schema
- **Proposal:** Automate the process of syncing changes from the development schema to the main schema using:
  - Schema comparison tools (e.g., `dbForge`, `Redgate`).
  - Custom scripts to apply differences automatically.

## 3. Automation of Template Creation
- **Objective:** Create or expand templates for all schema objects programmatically.
- **Supported Object Types:**
  1. Procedures
  2. Tables
  3. Views
  4. Functions
  5. Packages
  6. Sequences
  7. Synonyms
- **Implementation:**
  - Write SQL scripts or use tools to generate `CREATE` and `ALTER` statements for all schema objects.
  - Automate schema discovery and template generation using dynamic SQL or scripting languages (e.g., Python, Shell).

## 4. Syntax and Validation Checks
- **Objective:** Ensure syntax correctness and validate missing objects during template creation.
- **Key Features:**
  - Pre-defined rules for checking SQL syntax and adherence to standards.
  - Validation to ensure dependencies (e.g., missing tables for foreign key constraints) are in place.
- **Tools:**
  - Use database-specific utilities or custom scripts for syntax and validation checks.

## 5. Script Conversion Between Databases
- **Objective:** Enable seamless script conversion between Oracle and HANA (or vice versa).
- **Approach:**
  - Identify differences in syntax and features (e.g., `SEQUENCE` in Oracle vs. equivalent in HANA).
  - Use tools like `Flyway`, `Liquibase`, or custom parsers written in Python.

## 6. UC XML Automation
- **Objective:** Automate the creation and export of ETL XMLs and ATLs.
- **Steps:**
  1. Extract metadata from database objects.
  2. Use templates or scripting languages (e.g., Python, XSLT) to generate XML files.
  3. Integrate with version control systems for tracking changes.

# Future Enhancements
1. **Centralized Logging and Reporting:**
   - Create a dashboard to track schema changes, validations, and automation status.
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Extend support for other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
3. **Advanced Validation Rules:**
   - Include semantic checks (e.g., naming conventions, unused objects).
4. **Performance Tuning:**
   - Optimize automation scripts for large-scale schemas.
